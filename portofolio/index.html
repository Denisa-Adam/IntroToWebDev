Loves cheeseburgers pet me pet me don't pet me what a cat-ass-trophy! hack up furballs hopped up on catnip, or am in trouble, roll over, too cute for human to get mad so see owner, run in terror. Car rides are evil chirp at birds yet making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes chew the plant and terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry.  </p>

Cat jumps and falls onto the couch purrs and wakes up in a new dimension filled with kitty litter meow meow yummy there is a bunch of cats hanging around eating catnip i like fish. Steal mom's crouton while she is in the bathroom step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle . Meow loudly just to annoy owners.
