				<td>Cold chicken mixed in dressings. The finesse technique used in mixing the dish retained the freshness of the delightful juice contained within the chicken. The glowing gold chicken skin hides a mildly hot flavor underneath.</td>
				<td>The stuffing is taken from whole fresh shrimp, and the glistening quality of the flour can be guessed at from the translucence of the outer skin. Has a springy, tasty chew.</td>
				<td>A poached fish dish. The fresh and tasty fish fillets are tender and juicy. The secret to this recipe is adding powdered Violetgrass into the heated oil to give the dish that aromatic scent. It's spicy, but not too spicy.</td>

				<th>Come and Get It</th>
				<th>Triple-Layered Consommé</th>

			<tr>
				<td>A dish made out of a luxurious variety of ingredients. There is no great refinement in the making of this food. Whenever this dish is served up, the person at the head of the table will invite everyone to dig in, saying "Come on, eat, eat," hence the name.</td>
				<td>A neatly arranged dish. The ham, fowl, and bamboo shoots have been sliced into threads of equal length, and they've been laid out neatly in the soup bowl after being steamed at high heat, before being covered in consommé. The layers are distinct, and the mouthfeel is salty yet fresh.</td>
				<td>Colorful staple food. Maintains perfect balance between soft and fragrant rice and all kinds of carefully selected sweet ingredients. This dish is mainly known for its meaning as a symbol of prosperity and peace, and less so for its taste. However, with such noble ideals behind it, its flavor should not disappoint.</td>
